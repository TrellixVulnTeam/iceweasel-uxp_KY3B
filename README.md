# Iceweasel-UXP

[Iceweasel-UXP](https://wiki.hyperbola.info/doku.php?id=en:project:iceweasel-uxp) 
is a browser application built on the Unified XUL Platform, which intends to preserve 
the look and feel of Aurora. It's a re-branding of [Basilisk](https://www.basilisk-browser.org/) 
by Moonchild Productions, at the same a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository 
(mozilla-central) with an SR-52 fork point, preserving the original code base prior 
to Firefox 60's drastic web-engine changes.

Unlike previous [Iceweasel](https://fossforce.com/2017/02/great-debian-iceweasel-icedove-saga/) 
versions, Iceweasel-UXP is not just a rebranding of Firefox. It contains a new browser 
engine and has it's own codebase with support for modern web application technologies 
as well as legacy addons, in the spirit of cultural freedom and privacy.
